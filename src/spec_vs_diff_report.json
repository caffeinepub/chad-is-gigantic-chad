  "summary": "Diff adds new Frogger/Galaga/Minesweeper React pages and routes, updates Home and Leaderboard to include the new games and derives leaderboard tabs from backend getAvailableGames, and extends the Motoko backend with new per-game score maps plus an upgrade migration module. However, the required new preview image assets are not shown as added, and there are unrelated frontend theme/auth changes not requested.",

      "reason": "HomePage references these /assets/generated/* files, but the diff summary does not show any new static assets added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the required images are not evidenced as present.",

      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated before the implementations of submitScore() and the internal getGameScores() (or equivalent) switch/dispatch logic, so the diff summary does not provide evidence that the new game cases are handled without trapping and that 'best score only' replacement logic is preserved for the new games.",
